I am a computational hydroclimatologist. I have a Ph.D. in Civil and Environmental Engineering from the University of Washington.  I'm currently working as a scientist at the [National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu/) in the [Computational Hydrology Group](https://ncar.github.io/hydrology/) (part of the [Research Applications Laboratory's Hydrometeorological Applications Program](https://ral.ucar.edu/hap)). My research focuses on developing and evaluating computational hydrologic models to better understand the sources of uncertainty in future hydrologic projections.  I am an active developer of a number of open-source Python, C, and Fortran [software](/software) projects. I also am available to do a bit of [consulting](/consulting).
