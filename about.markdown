I am a climate scientist and engineer.

Today, I'm the co-founder and CTO at [Earthmover](https://earthmover.io/). We're building Arraylake, the cloud platform for scientific data teams.

Prior to starting Earthmover, I was a founder and Technology Director at [CarbonPlan](https://carbonplan.org) and a scientist in the [Climate and Global Dynamics Laboratory](https://www.cgd.ucar.edu/) at the [National Center for Atmospheric Research](https://ncar.ucar.edu/). I'm a licensed Professional Engineer in Washington State and I have a Ph.D. in [Civil and Environmental Engineering from the University of Washington](https://www.ce.washington.edu/). I am an active developer of a number of open-source [software](/software) projects.
