#### Pangeo
[Pangeo](https://pangeo.io) is a community effort for big data in the geosciences. As part of this effort, we are bringing together the a collection of Python tools, including Xarray, Dask, and Jupyter to facilitate highly scalable data analytics on large geoscientific datasets. I am one of the co-founders of the Pangeo project and sit on the [Pangeo Steering Council](https://github.com/pangeo-data/governance).

#### Xarray

[Xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org) is the fusion of Python's Pandas, Numpy, and netCDF4 packages. It offers unparalleled computational ability on labeled N-dimensional arrays. I have been contributing to the Xarray project since May 2014.

#### Dask
[Dask](https://dask.org/) is Python a library for scalable computing with dynamic task scheduling. As part of my work with Pangeo and Xarray, I have been contributing to the Dask ecosystem. In particular, I have worked extensively on Dask deployment utilities like [Dask-jobqueue](https://jobqueue.dask.org/en/latest/) and [Dask-Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.dask.org/en/latest/).

#### Zarr

[Zarr](https://zarr.dev) is a data format and for chunked, compressed, multidimensional arrays. It is designed for working with large scientific datasets and supports multiple backend storage interfaces (cloud storage, https, posix, etc.). I am on the Zarr core team and have mostly focused on optimizations for working with Zarr from Xarray and Dask.
